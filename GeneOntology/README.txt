This directory contains scripts for parsing both the gene ontology and the gene annotations file.

For the ontology, we assume the input file is an obo file. The annotations file should be a tsv.

To extract nodes and edges from the obo file, please use parse_obo.py.

To extract gene nodes from an annotations file, please run extract_files.py and then extract_gene_nodes.py.
